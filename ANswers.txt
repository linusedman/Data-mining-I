TASK 1: reading the data 

What data type have you assigned to attribute id? 
Integers

What do you think is the practical consequence of setting this data type? 
An id can only have an integer value hence they are discrete.

What are the average length of sepals (sl) and their standard deviation? 
Average length: -5.7, Standard deviation: 303.8

TASK 2: database preprocessing 

How many instances are there for each class? 

Virginica   
2998
Setosa        
2996
Versicolor  
500
TASK 3: data cleaning 

Why is it important to let the system know which values are missing? 

What are the average length of sepals (sl) and their standard deviation after declaring missing values (3.1)? 

What are the average length of sepals (sl) and their standard deviation after removing outliers (3.2)? 

Do you think the outliers you have removed were noise (that is, wrong measurements) or unusual but correct observations? 

Would you first handle missing data and then remove outliers, or the other way round? Why? 

Assume  your  observations  (records)  represent  people  in  a  social  network,  and  one variable stores their degree centrality. Would you remove outliers in this case? why? 

TASK 4: data transformation 

What  are  the  average  length  and  standard  deviation  of  sepals  after  min-max normalization? 

What are the average length and standard deviation of sepals after standardization? 

How many components have been selected after 4.3? 

How much variance is captured by the first two components? 

How is the first component defined as a combination of the original attributes? 

How many components would have been selected after 4.4 (that is, with an attribute expressed on a larger range)? 

How many components would have been selected after 4.5 (that is, with an outlier)? 

TASK 5: 

Number of iris versicolor 

Number of iris setosa 

Simple sampling 

Bootstrapping  

Stratified (5.3) 

Stratified (5.4) 

Number of iris virginica 

Are there repeated identifiers? 
Does the number of iris versicolor included in the sample change if you change the local random seed?
